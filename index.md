## Overview

xrdp provides a graphical login to remote machines using RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol). xrdp accepts connections from variety of RDP clients: FreeRDP, rdesktop, NeutrinoRDP and Microsoft Remote Desktop Client (for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android).

As Windows-to-Windows Remote Desktop can, xrdp supports not only graphics remoting but also

* two-way clipboard transfer (text, bitmap, file)
* audio redirection
* drive redirection (mount local client drives on remote machine)

RDP transport is encrypted using TLS by default.
